# DG1D-CPP-development
Development of the discontinuous Galerkin C++ code based on Peter Diener's Fortran code found in the DG1D-Fortran-test repository.

To run this code, it is necessary to install the TNT and JAMA matrix
libraries, found at http://math.nist.gov/tnt/overview.html.

It is also necessary to install the libconfig library, found at
http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig. This can also be installed
through Macports using
sudo port install libconfig-hr
if you are running this on a Mac.
